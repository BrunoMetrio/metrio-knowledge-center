### Structure the report

Now the report structure can be set. The report structure window includes:

* Report sections
* Report sub-sections
* Report pages
* Status of sections, sub-sections, pages
* Creation information
* Page status: Number of pages in the report and a summary of pages that are in the Draft, Ready, and Publish stage

The **Homepage** will always appear as the first page in the report structure. The position of the Homepage in the report cannot be changed.

Hover between report elements and click **(+)** to add additional report elements. When creating a new report, the first thing that must be added is a section.

Click **(+)** under an existing report element to add nested elements or additional, separate sections.\*\* Repeat until the desired layout of sections, sub-sections, and pages has been created.

\*\* Sections cannot contain other sections, and sub-sections cannot contain other sub-sections. Sub-sections are optional, as pages can be nested directly under sections.

The report will be locked to other users until the editor is finished editing. Grab the dots icon **(****⋮****)** to the left of a report element to move sections, sub-sections, or pages within the report.

Drag and drop the element into the desired location. Pages can be moved from one sub-section or section to another. The indent of the dashed box will indicate where the element will land.
