Overview of CAM Tool
--------------------

The Carbon Accounting & Management (CAM) tool is a set of configured objects across the modules (Data Sources, Metrics and Publisher) of the Nasdaq Metrio product designed to accurately and transparently calculate Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It streamlines the complex process of GHG accounting, offering significant benefits over manual calculations, including improved accuracy, reduced errors, increased efficiency, and enhanced transparency in reporting.

The CAM tool operates by ingesting data from various sources (referred to as "data sources"), which can include energy and fuel consumption records, waste disposal data, or purchased goods and services information. This raw data then undergoes a series of transformations within the tool using a series of custom calculations, called "metrics," written in Python. These metrics perform calculations, aggregations, and conversions, ultimately leading to the calculation of total Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. The final results are presented in a clear and easily understandable format, allowing for comprehensive GHG emission reporting and analysis.

A key feature of the CAM tool is its modular design. Individual metrics can be easily reviewed and audited, ensuring transparency and allowing for adaptation to evolving accounting standards, regulatory requirements and data availability. The tool also enables the tracking of data provenance, meaning the origin and transformations of each data point are meticulously recorded, adding to the overall reliability and audibility of the results. This traceability fosters greater confidence in the reported emission figures. Furthermore, the tool's flexible architecture allows for easy incorporation of new data sources and calculation methods as needed.
