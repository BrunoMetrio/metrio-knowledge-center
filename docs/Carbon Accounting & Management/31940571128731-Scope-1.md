Scope 1 emissions refer to direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. These emissions typically include those from stationary combustion, mobile combustion, and process emissions. The CAM tool provides a detailed methodology for calculating Scope 1 emissions, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the reporting process.

### Data Transformation Process:

The CAM tool processes raw data from various sources to provide accurate Scope 1 emission metrics, ingesting data related to stationary and mobile combustion, as well as other direct emissions, and normalizing it into a unified dimension. This involves converting different units of measurement (e.g., kWh, GJ, MWh) into a default unit for consistency and accuracy. The tool uses custom energy densities provided by the users to support inter-dimension conversions, ensuring that all data is accurately represented in the default unit.

### Metrics Used:

* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_factors: Exposes built-in conversion factors from Metrio's metrics SDK.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_custom\_energy\_densities\_stationary\_combustion: Normalizes units of custom energy densities for stationary combustion.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_stationary\_combustion\_energy: Converts energy-based stationary combustion data into the default unit (GJ).
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_mobile\_combustion\_volume: Converts volume-based mobile combustion data into the default unit.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_scope\_1\_emissions\_mobile\_combustion\_volume: Calculates Scope 1 GHG emissions for volume-based mobile combustion.

### Calculation Methodology:

* Data Collection: The tool collects data from various sources, including energy bills, fuel consumption records, and other relevant documents. This data is then validated to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Unit Conversion: The tool converts all data into a default unit (e.g., GJ for energy) to maintain consistency across different data sources.
* Emission Factors: The tool applies predefined emission factors to the normalized data. These factors are derived from reliable sources such as the Climatiq database and custom emission factors provided by the user.
* Calculation of Emissions: The tool calculates the total Scope 1 emissions by multiplying the normalized data by the corresponding emission factors. The calculations are performed in a way that ensures consistency and accuracy across all data points.

#### *Example Calculation:*

For a building with natural gas consumption, the tool would use the energy consumption data (e.g., in kWh) and convert it to the default unit (GJ). It would then apply the appropriate emission factor to calculate the total GHG emissions for that building. The tool ensures that all calculations are transparent and auditable, providing a clear and accurate representation of the organization's Scope 1 emissions.

By accurately processing and transforming data related to direct emissions, the CAM tool ensures reliable Scope 1 emission calculations, helping organizations manage their carbon footprint effectively.
