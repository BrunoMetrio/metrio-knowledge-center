The CAM tool includes robust estimation methods to handle missing data in key areas, ensuring that the carbon emission calculations remain accurate and comprehensive. These methods are based on intensities defined in the CBECS (Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey) datasources or custom intensities provided by the user. Furthermore, clients have the flexibility to enter their own estimated values if needed, enhancing the tool's adaptability and precision. The estimation process involves several key steps and conditions:

### Logic and Conditions:

* **Identification of Missing Data**: The tool first identifies any missing data points in the energy consumption records due to incomplete data entry, missing energy bills, or other gaps in the data collection process.
* **Selection of Estimation Method**: Depending on the type of missing data, the tool selects the appropriate estimation method based on intensities related to floor surface area, building activity, climate zone, or building size. Estimation can be enabled or disabled at the site level per the user’s preference.
* **Application of Intensities:** The tool applies predefined intensities to estimate the missing data, derived from the CBECS datasources or custom intensities provided by the user, and adjusted based on factors such as building activity and climate zone.
* **Calculation of Estimated Values:** The tool calculates the estimated values for the missing data points using the selected intensities, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all data points.

### Metrics Used:

* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_estimations\_energy\_consumption\_stationary\_combustion\_natural\_gas\_cu\_ft: Estimates missing monthly consumption data for natural gas based on intensities related to floor surface area, building activity, and climate zone.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_estimations\_energy\_consumption\_electricity\_energy: Estimates missing monthly consumption data for purchased electricity based on intensities related to building size and activity.

### Data Validation:

By using these estimation methods, the CAM tool ensures that the carbon emission calculations remain accurate and reliable, even in the presence of incomplete data. This approach helps organizations maintain a comprehensive and accurate carbon accounting system.
