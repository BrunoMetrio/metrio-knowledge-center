Scope 2
=======

Updated December 17, 2024 02:56

Scope 2 emissions refer to indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling. These emissions occur at the facility where the energy is generated, not at the point of use. The CAM tool provides a detailed methodology for calculating Scope 2 emissions, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the reporting process.

### Data Transformation Process:

The CAM tool processes raw data from various sources to provide accurate Scope 2 emission metrics, reading in data related to purchased electricity and other energy sources, and normalizing it into a unified dimension. This involves converting different units of measurement (e.g., kWh, GJ, MWh) into a default unit for consistency and accuracy.

### Metrics Used:

* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_factors: Exposes built-in conversion factors from Metrio's metrics SDK.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_purchased\_electricity\_energy: Converts purchased electricity data into the default unit (kWh).
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_scope\_2\_others\_kwh: Converts scope 2 data other than purchased electricity into the default unit (kWh).
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_scope\_2\_emissions\_electricity\_location\_based: Calculates location-based scope 2 GHG emissions for purchased electricity.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_scope\_2\_emissions\_electricity\_market\_based: Calculates market-based scope 2 GHG emissions for purchased electricity.
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_scope\_2\_others\_mtco2e: Calculates scope 2 GHG emissions for purchased energy consumption data other than purchased electricity.

### Calculation Methodology:

* Data Collection: The tool collects data from various sources, including energy bills and other relevant documents. This data is then validated to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Unit Conversion: The tool converts all data into a default unit (e.g., kWh for electricity) to maintain consistency across different data sources.
* Emission Factors: The tool applies predefined emission factors to the normalized data. These factors are derived from reliable sources such as the Climatiq database and custom emission factors provided by the user.
* Calculation of Emissions: The tool calculates the total Scope 2 emissions by multiplying the normalized data by the corresponding emission factors. The calculations are performed in a way that ensures consistency and accuracy across all data points.

### Logic for Market-Based and Location-Based Emission Factors:

* Location-Based Emission Factors: These factors are based on the average emissions intensity of the grid where the electricity consumption occurs. The CAM tool uses location-specific emission factors from the Climatiq database or custom emission factors provided by the user. The tool reads in the facility information and assigns the most accurate location-based emission factor available based on the facility's location.
* Market-Based Emission Factors: These factors are based on the specific emissions intensity of the electricity purchased by the organization, which can include renewable energy certificates (RECs), power purchase agreements (PPAs), or equivalent certificates in line with GHG Protocol methodology. The CAM tool uses market-based emission factors from the custom emission factors database. The tool reads in the facility information and assigns the market-based emission factor based on the specific electricity purchase agreements in place. If the market-based emissions factors are not provided for some sites, the system will use location-based emissions to fill the gap.

#### *Example:*

For a facility with purchased electricity consumption, the tool would use the energy consumption data (e.g., in kWh or other energy unit) and convert it to the default unit (kWh). It would then apply the appropriate emission factor (location-based or market-based) to calculate the total GHG emissions for that facility. The tool ensures that all calculations are transparent and auditable, providing a clear and accurate representation of the organization's Scope 2 emissions.
