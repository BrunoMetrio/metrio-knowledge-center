Scope 3 - Categories 1 and 2: Purchased Goods and Services, Capital Goods
=========================================================================

Updated July 10, 2025 19:45

The CAM tool provides a detailed methodology for calculating emissions from all Scope 3 Categorie, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the reporting process.

### Scope 3 Categories 1 and 2: Purchased Goods and Services, and Capital Goods

Scope 3 Categories 1 and 2 emissions refer to the indirect GHG emissions associated with the production of goods and services purchased by the organization (Category 1) and the production of capital goods (Category 2). These emissions occur upstream in the value chain and are a significant component of an organization's overall carbon footprint.

#### *Data Transformation Process:*

The CAM tool processes raw data from various sources to provide accurate Scope 3 Categories 1 and 2 emission metrics. It reads in data related to purchased goods, services, and capital goods, and normalizes it into a unified dimension. This involves converting different units of measurement (e.g., USD, EUR, CAD) into a default unit for consistency and accuracy. The tool uses custom conversion factors to support inter-dimension conversions, ensuring that all data is accurately represented in the default unit.

#### *Metrics Used:*

* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_conversion\_scope\_3\_cat\_1\_and\_2\_usd: Converts spend-based scope 3 categories 1 and 2 (purchased goods and capital goods) data into the default unit (USD)
* packages\_ghgtool\_metric\_scope\_3\_cat\_1\_and\_2\_mtco2e: Calculates spend-based scope 3 GHG emissions for categories 1 and 2 consumption data (purchased goods and capital goods)

#### *Calculation Methodology:*

The CAM tool uses a systematic approach to calculate Scope 3 Categories 1 and 2 emissions. The methodology involves several key steps:

* Data Collection: The tool collects data from various sources, including purchase records, invoices, and other relevant documents. This data is then validated to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Unit Conversion: The tool converts all data into a default unit (e.g., USD) to maintain consistency across different data sources.
* Emission Factors: The tool applies predefined emission factors to the normalized data. These factors are derived from reliable sources such as the Climatiq database and custom emission factors provided by the user.
* Calculation of Emissions: The tool calculates the total Scope 3 Categories 1 and 2 emissions by multiplying the normalized data by the corresponding emission factors. The calculations are performed in a way that ensures consistency and accuracy across all data points.

#### *Example Calculation:*

For a company with purchased goods and services, the tool would use the spend data (e.g., in USD) and convert it to the default unit (USD). It would then apply the appropriate emission factor to calculate the total GHG emissions for those purchases. The tool ensures that all calculations are transparent and auditable, providing a clear and accurate representation of the organization's Scope 3 Categories 1 and 2 emissions.
