Task Manager - set specific due date for each step
--------------------------------------------------

You can now set different due dates for each step within a task, allowing for finer-grained control over your project timelines. This includes steps such as Data Collection, Approval 1, Approval 2, and any other custom steps you define.

Automated email reminders for task step due dates
-------------------------------------------------

* A notification email is sent to the data collector on the task's start date;
* Three days prior to each step's due date, a reminder email is sent to all assignees of that step;
* If a step's due date is exceeded, a daily reminder email will be sent to all assignees of that step and for a maximum of 30 days.

Note: Following user feedback, email notifications will no longer be sent to task creators.

Task Manager - create or update tasks using Excel import
--------------------------------------------------------

We have introduced a new feature allowing users to import or update tasks from an Excel spreadsheet. This streamlined process supports bulk task creation and modification, significantly improving efficiency.
