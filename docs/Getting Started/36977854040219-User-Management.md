User Management
===============

Updated December 17, 2025 15:47

In SDM, the user management system provides teams with roles and permissions, allowing for more granular control over user access within your account. Admins can manage users' access to entire modules or specific objects within those modules. 

### Definitions

* **Modules**: Data Sources, Metrics, Publisher, Frameworks
* **Objects**: Specific items within each module
  + **Data Sources objects**: Data sources
  + **Metrics objects**: Metrics
  + **Publisher objects**: Reports and dashboards
  + **Frameworks**: Access is given to the whole framework, as it does not contain specific objects

### Role Types

* **Global admin**
  + Can create new users, manage their roles, deactivate / reactivate users.
  + Has module admin permissions on all modules.
* **Module admin**
  + Can add / remove and manage user roles within their module.
  + Can edit, assign tasks, create new objects.
* **Contributor**, this role can be assigned to an entire module or specific objects
  + Can edit and assign tasks on objects.
* **Viewer**, this role can be assigned to an entire module or specific objects
  + Has read-only access to objects.
* **No role**
  + Does not have access to a module

### Users Page

Global admins can access the user management system from the Users page, located at the bottom of the left-hand navigation menu.

* **Global admins:** inherently admins in all modules, their roles in each module are not editable. To assign or unassign a global admin, click the "More" icon [...], and select "Set as global admin" or "Revoke global admin".
* **Viewer or Contributor:** users assigned the Viewer or Contributor role in a module have that role applied across the entire module.
* **Object roles:** When a user has access to specific objects (but not all) within a module—such as Viewer and Contributor roles—the number of objects they can access will be displayed next to the Object Roles label.
  + Setting object roles: Object level roles can be managed from each object's page
