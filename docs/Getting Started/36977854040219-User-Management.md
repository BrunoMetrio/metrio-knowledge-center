User Management
===============

Updated June 19, 2025 17:39

Our new user management system (April 2025) provides you with enhanced roles and permissions, allowing for more granular control over user access within your account. You can manage users' access to entire modules or specific objects within those modules.

This guide will walk you through the new features and how to utilize them effectively.

**Accessing the New System**

To navigate to the new user management system, select **Users**, at the bottom of the left-hand menu.

**Definitions**

* **Modules**: Data Sources, Metrics, Publisher, Frameworks
* **Objects**: Specific items within each module
  + **Data Sources Objects**: Data sources
  + **Metrics Objects**: Metrics
  + **Publisher Objects**: Reports and dashboards
  + **Frameworks**: Access is given to the whole framework, as it does not contain specific objects

**Role Types**

* **Global Admin**: Can create new users, manage their roles, delete users, and has module admin permissions on all modules.
* **Module Admin**: Can edit, assign tasks, create new objects, and manage user roles within their module.
* **Contributor**: Can edit and assign tasks on objects. This role can be assigned to an entire module or specific objects.
* **Viewer**: Has read-only access to objects. This role can be assigned to an entire module or specific objects.
